# Problem Statement - Wine Quality Prediction

## Case Study: Wine Quality Prediction

### Context:
Wine is a beverage made from fermented grapes and other fruit juices with a low amount of alcohol content. Wine is the second most popular alcoholic drink in the world after beer, and it is one of the most highly consumed beverages.

Generally, the quality of wine is graded based on the taste of the wine and vintage, but this process is time-consuming, costly, and not efficient, as the quality of the wine also depends on other physiochemical attributes like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, etc. Additionally, it is not always possible to ensure wine quality by experts when there is a huge demand for the product, as it will significantly increase the cost.

Moonshine is a red wine company that produces premium high-quality wines. The company wants to improve its production efficiency and reduce the cost and additional time involved in wine tasting.

As a data scientist at Moonshine, your task is to build a predictive model that can help identify premium quality wines using the available data.

### Objective:
The dataset aims to answer the following key questions:

- **What are the different factors that can help in identifying a premium high-quality wine?**
- **Can we build a model to identify high-quality wines? What should be the metric of choice to evaluate such a model?**

### Attribute Information:

- **fixed acidity:** Fixed Acidity imparts sourness and resists microbial infection, measured in grams of tartaric acid per dm³.
- **volatile acidity:** Grams of acetic acid per dm³ of wine. High levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste.
- **citric acid:** Grams of citric acid per dm³ of wine. Citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines.
- **residual sugar:** Remaining sugar after fermentation stops, measured in grams per dm³.
- **chlorides:** Grams of sodium chloride (salt) per dm³ of wine.
- **free sulfur dioxide:** Grams of free sulfite per dm³ of wine.
- **total sulfur dioxide:** Grams of total sulfite (free sulfite + bound) per dm³ of wine.
- **density:** Density in grams per cm³.
- **pH:** Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). The pH of the wine can help measure the ripeness of the wine.
- **sulphates:** Grams of potassium sulfate per dm³ of wine.
- **alcohol:** Volume of alcohol in percentage.
- **quality:** Wine quality score between 3 to 8.
