Based on the feature importance chart you've provided, it looks like the most critical factors influencing whether a customer will leave their credit card services are related to their transaction activity and revolving balance. Here are some recommendations for Thera Bank based on these insights:

1. Enhance Transaction-Related Engagement:
Incentivize Frequent Transactions: Since the total transaction count (Total_Trans_Ct) and amount (Total_Trans_Amt) are highly important, consider implementing loyalty programs that reward customers for frequent use of their credit cards. This could be in the form of cashback, points, or other benefits that increase as transaction count or amount increases.
Targeted Promotions: Tailor promotions and offers to customers based on their transaction patterns. For example, offer discounts or bonuses for certain types of transactions that are relevant to the customerâ€™s spending history.
2. Manage Revolving Balance:
Flexible Payment Plans: Provide customers with options to manage their revolving balance (Total_Revolving_Bal), such as flexible payment plans, lower interest rates for on-time payments, or balance transfer options to reduce financial stress.
Educational Campaigns: Educate customers on the benefits of maintaining a lower revolving balance and how it can positively impact their credit score and financial health.
3. Monitor and Improve Customer Relationships:
Proactive Customer Support: Since total relationship count (Total_Relationship_Count) and the number of contacts (Contacts_Count_12_mon) are also important, establish a proactive customer support system that regularly checks in with customers to understand their needs and offer personalized services.
Cross-Selling Opportunities: Use the insights from the relationship count to offer additional products or services that align with the customer's existing profile, further deepening their engagement with the bank.
4. Focus on Recent Transaction Changes:
Analyze Changes in Behavior: The features related to changes in transaction amount and count between quarters (Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1 and Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1) suggest that sudden changes in spending behavior could be a red flag. Implement monitoring systems that flag significant drops or increases in these metrics, and then reach out to these customers to understand their needs or concerns.
Seasonal Offers: Align promotional offers with the analysis of quarterly changes. For example, if there is typically a drop in transactions during certain quarters, introduce seasonal offers or bonuses to maintain customer engagement during these periods.
5. Utilization Ratio Management:
Balance Utilization Alerts: Since Avg_Utilization_Ratio is a key feature, consider sending alerts to customers when their utilization ratio gets too high, along with advice or options for managing it. This could help prevent them from feeling financially overextended, reducing the likelihood of attrition.
6. Customer Segmentation and Targeted Retention Strategies:
Segment Customers Based on Features: Use the feature importance rankings to create customer segments based on their transaction activity, relationship count, and revolving balance. Develop targeted retention strategies for each segment, such as personalized offers, special services, or early intervention for high-risk customers.
By focusing on these areas, Thera Bank can likely reduce the rate of attrition and improve customer satisfaction, leading to more sustainable business growth.
