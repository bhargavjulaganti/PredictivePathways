# How to calculate silhouette cofficient ?
Silhouette score is a measurement of how similar points within a cluster are to each other compared to how similar those points are to neighboring clusters.

## Notes: 
 - If the silhouette value is close to 1, the sample is well-clustered and points are already assigned to a very appropriate cluster.
 - The silhouette value ranges between -1 to 1
